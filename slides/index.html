					<h3>What's lock service? Why I need it?</h3>
					<blockquote>
						"The purpose of the lock service is to allow its clients
						to synchronize their activities and to agree on basic information about their environment."
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote> "... to elect a master, to allow the
						master to discover the servers it controls, and to permit
						clients to find the master"</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why not just use Paxos?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Hard to retrofit to existing apps</li>
						<li>You still need name service (e.g. to announce leader)</li>
						<li>Lock-based interface is familiar to developers</li>
						<li>Consensus is impractical with large clusters</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Features:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Scalable advertising. </li>
						<li>Event notifications. </li>
						<li>Quick and consistent reads.</li>
						<li><q>To avoid both financial loss and jail time, we provide
							security mechanisms, including access control.</q></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Thousands of clients can watch the same file</li>
							<li>I will tell you when the file is changed deleted etc.</li>
							<li>You can read as many times as you want!</li>
							<li>ACL's. This makes me chuckle every time i read it.</li>
						</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Two main components: Server and Library</li>
							<li>A Chubby cell usually contains 5 servers</li>
							<li>Client connects ONLY to master</li>
							<li>Writes are propagated via Consensus Protocol to replicas</li>
							<li></li>
						</ul>

				<section>
					<h3>File and Directories</h3>
					<pre>/ls/foo/wombat/pouch</pre>
					<ul>
						<li>ls - <i>locks service</i> prefix</li>
						<li>foo - name of Chubby cell (resolved via DNS)</li>
						<li>wombat/pouch - resolved within cell</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>File system like path</li>
							<li>ls - lock service preffix</li>
							<li>foo - chubby cell name (resolved via DNS)</li>
							<li>wombat/pouch - resolved inside cell</li>
							<li>Files/ Directories - called nodes</li>
							<li>No: symliks, moving files, directory modified times, directory level permissions - To make caching easier</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Node</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Permanent</li>
						<li>Ephemeral</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Permanent as name suggests persists until deleted</p>
						<p>Ephemeral - file exists as long as someone has open handle to it. Used for example to tell other clients that you are alive</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Locks</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Distributed locks are difficult
						<p>
							<q>a process holding a lock L may issue a request R, but then fail. Another process may acquire L and perform some action before R arrives at its
								destination. If R later arrives, it may be acted on without
								the protection of L, and potentially on inconsistent data</q>
						</p></li>
						<li>Sequencers</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
					</aside>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>API</h3>
					<pre>
						<code class="java" data-trim >
						handle = chubby.Open("/ls/foo/wombat/pouch")

						handle.Acquire() // or TryAcquire()
						sequencer = handle.GetSequencer()

						// call some external service using Sequencer.

						// when fail or done
						handle.Release()
							</code>

					<h3>Caching</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Consistent</li>
						<li>File, no file, meta-data, handles</li>

						<li>Invalidation instead of Updates</li>
						<li>Write invalidates caches</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Sessions and Keep Alive</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Lease based</li>
						<li>Minimal communication (blocking RPC)</li>
						<li>Cache invalidation</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h3>Scale</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>90,000 direct clients (!?!?!?!)</li>
						<li>One Chubby cell per data center</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Use and behaviour</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Typical stats:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>22k direct clients</li>
							<li>1k locks</li>
							<li>RPC rate 1-2k/s (93% Keep Alives)</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Outages</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>61 outages over few weeks</li>
						<ul>
							<li>52 less that 30s</li>
							<li>4 network maintenance</li>
							<li>2 suspected network problems</li>
							<li>2 software errors</li>
							<li>1 overload</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Lost data 6 times</li>
						<ul>
							<li>4 software errors</li>
							<li>2 operator error</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						"Ironically, the operational errors involved upgrades
						to avoid the software errors."

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Abusive clients</h3>
					<p>
						<q>
							Despite attempts at education, our developers regularly write loops that retry
							indefinitely when a file is not present, or poll a file by
							opening it and closing it repeatedly...
						</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>... In the end it was easier to make
							repeated Open() calls cheap</q>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Developers rarely consider availability</li>
						<li>Fine-grained locking could be ignored </li>
						<li>RPC use affects transport protocol</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Developers are inclined to treat Chubby as always available which magnifies the blast radius
						One of the teams initiated very expensive recovery every time new chubby master was elected ( 100's of machines)

						- No one needed yet fine-grain locking service.
						- Developers found that to optimize their application they need to reduce communication

						- They had to switch KeepAlives to UDP because TCP has congestion avoidance which slows down the delivery of KeepAlives.

					<h3>What I love about this paper</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Impossible design that works</li>
						<li>Focus on ease of use</li>
